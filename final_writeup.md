# Headset Recommendations App ðŸŽ§

## Background
This project invovles web scraping headset data from [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) using an API, building a regression model to predict headset prices, deploying the model through a Flask API on Google Cloud to run the model, and creating an interactive web application using Streamlit. 

The goal is to allow users to input headset features and receive a predicted prince along with a list of similar headset recommendations. This tool can help users better understand headset pricing and make more informed purchasing decisions. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The initial dataset contains 2417 headsets with the following columns: `brand`, `model`, `form_factor`, `frequency_response`, `has_microphone`, `is_wireless`, `type`, `color`, `price`. `frequency_response`, `color`, and `price` have missing values.
